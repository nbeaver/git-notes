# Setting up a remote repository on a server. Technically it doesn't have to end with .git, but it's less easily mistaken for a normal directory if you do.
git init --bare tidier-pdfimages.git
# Creates a folder tidier-pdfimages.git/ with the contents of .git/ in a normal repository
# Done for now with the remote machine. Now just add a remote on your laptop (or whatever you want to push to the server with).

#  Add a remote repository
git remote add origin git@github.com:user/repository.git # uses SSH, which is good since you can set up SSH keys instead of entering a password every time.
git remote add origin git@github.com:nbeaver/custom-units.git # example
git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repository.git # uses HTTPS, which will require entering a password a lot.
git remote add chloride ssh://nbeaver@chloride.phys.iit.edu:/home/nbeaver/git-repositories/tidier-pdfimages.git # absolute paths
git remote add chloride nbeaver@chloride.phys.iit.edu:git-repositories/tidier-pdfimages.git # relative paths; you have to drop the leading ssh:// part

# Push to a remote repository (in this case, push the master branch)
git push -u origin master
git push -u chloride master
# Change the url for a remote repository
# It is better to use SSH than https, since you won't have to log in every time, like this:
git remote set-url origin "git@github.com:nbeaver/name-of-repo.git"
# Not this:
git remote set-url origin "https://github.com/nbeaver/name-of-repo.git"
# Show the url for a remote repository without logging in.
git remote show -n origin
# Show all about a remote repository without logging in.
git remote show origin

# List existing remote repositories
git remote
git remote --verbose
git remote -v

# List all files ever tracked by the git repository
git ls-tree --full-tree -r HEAD
# List just the files being tracked right now

# Simple merging, e.g. merge into master branch.
git checkout master
git merge my_branch_name

# Merging a pull request
git checkout my_branch
# Pull from remote repository and branch
git pull https://github.com/christopherdavidwhite/commutator-table.git master
# Then checkout master and merge if it's good. Finally, push it back to the remote repository of choice, e.g.:
git checkout master
git merge christopherdavidwhite-master
git push origin master
